    Hello! My name is Christian Ken Bugto, and I'm from Caloocan City. Currently, I'm a third-year college student at Global Reciprocal Colleges, pursuing a degree in BSIT. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places, trying out local food spots, and spending quality time with friends and family. I'm dedicated, enthusiastic, and always eager to learn and grow in my chosen field.
